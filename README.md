to the extended attributes for filesystem objects available in some
operating systems.

## Requirements

The current supported Python versions are 3.7+ (tested up to 3.10), or
PyPy versions 3.7+ (tested up to 3.9). The code should currently be
compatible down to Python 3.4, but such versions are no longer tested.

The library has been written and tested on Linux, kernel v2.4 or
later, with XFS and ext2/ext3/ext4 file systems, and MacOS recent
versions. If any other platform implements the same behaviour,
pyxattr could be used.

To build the module from source, you will need both a Python
development environment/libraries and the C compiler, plus the
setuptools tool installed, and for building the documentation you need
to have Sphinx installed. The exact list of dependencies depends on
the operating system/distribution, but should be something along the
lines of `python3-devel` (RedHat), `python3-all-dev` (Debian), etc.

Alternatively, you can install directly from pip after installing the
above depedencies (C compiler, Python development libraries):

    pip install pyxattr

Or you can install already compiled versions from your distribution,
e.g. in Debian:

    sudo apt install python3-pyxattr

## Basic example

    >>> import xattr
    >>> xattr.listxattr("file.txt")
    ['user.mime_type']
    >>> xattr.getxattr("file.txt", "user.mime_type")
    'text/plain'
    >>> xattr.setxattr("file.txt", "user.comment", "Simple text file")
    >>> xattr.listxattr("file.txt")
    ['user.mime_type', 'user.comment']
    >>> xattr.removexattr ("file.txt", "user.comment")

hence the change to LGPL 2.1), and even older versions were licensed under GPL
